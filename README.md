## Using Dark Mode

The Exchange Rate Tracker includes a dark mode feature that can be toggled using the moon/sun icon in the top right corner. The app will also automatically detect your system's color scheme preference on first load.

## Technical Details

- Uses multiple API sources with fallback mechanisms for reliable data
- Implements client-side data fetching with CORS support
- Uses Chart.js for data visualization
- Includes a date range picker for flexible time period selection
- All processing happens in the browser with no backend requirements
- Provides fallback mechanisms for cryptocurrency rates

## Updates in this Version

- Fixed data loading issues by implementing multiple API sources with fallback
- Added dark mode support with system preference detection
- Fixed dark mode styling for the date picker component
- Added detailed status messages and error reporting
- Improved error handling and fallback mechanisms for unsupported currency pairs
- Enhanced visualization for both light and dark modes
- Added responsive design improvements for better embedding

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Data not loading**: The app now uses multiple data sources with fallbacks. If one API fails, it will automatically try others or use synthetic data as a last resort.

2. **Dark mode issues**: If the date picker doesn't match the dark mode theme, try toggling dark mode off and on again.

3. **Browser console errors**: Check your browser's developer tools (F12) for any error messages that might help identify issues.

## Limitations

- Free public APIs may have rate limits or data availability constraints
- Some cryptocurrency rates are simulated for demonstration purposes
- Historical data may be limited depending on the API used
